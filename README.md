The dataset for Google stocks is obtained from Yahoo Finance using Quantmod package in R. The timeline of the data is from 2015 till present day (4/26/2020).

A forecasting algorithm is a process that seeks to predict future values based on the past and present data. These historical data points are extracted and prepared trying to predict future values for a selected variable of the dataset. During market history there have been a continuous interest trying to analyze its tendencies, behavior and random reactions. This continuous concern to understand what happens before it really happens motivates us to continue with this study. We shall also try and understand the impact of COVID-19 disaster on the stock prices.
